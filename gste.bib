abstract={We show how we have successfully identified the bug of a real chip by using formal verification techniques. Since excessive number of simulation cycles are necessary to debug the chip design, formal verification techniques, specifically CTL symbolic model checking, were adopted to identify the bug. We demonstrate several approaches including abstraction, which make it possible to apply symbolic model checking methods. The methods and ideas reported here are general enough for diagnosing other real chips},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper reports on the development and formal verification (proof
of semantic preservation) of CompCert, a compiler from Clight (a
large subset of the C programming language) to PowerPC assembly code,
using the Coq proof assistant both for programming the compiler and
for proving its correctness.  Such a verified compiler is useful in
the context of critical software and its formal verification: the
verification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties
proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as
well.}

  abstract = {We present an implementation of STE model checking in the higher-order
    logic theorem prover HOL. The motivation for such an implementation
    is to have an open source framework in which we can exploit the strengths
    of STE model checking and HOL theorem proving. We intend to use this
    framework for future experiments in the design and implementation
    of abstraction and reduction techniques to extend the reach of STE
    model checking. We show in this implementation how a deep embedding
    of STE in HOL allows us to reason about the STE verification results.
    By virtue of using HOL, we also have the possibility to prove that
    the abstraction and reduction techniques are sound.}
